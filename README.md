# About this journal

Sharing my life experience with the hope that it can be of some help to someone.

From A-Grade student to a failure one, from an unofficial assistant helper in a local mobile repairing shop to a graduate student, from non-IT graduate to Google certified and professional developer, I have learnt to enjoy the roll-coaster ride of life especially because of a habit of writing down my feelings, emotions and its frequent analysis to continuously improve myself. I have experienced family stress, domestic violence, bullying, toxic people, depression, chronic illness, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, hypersensitivity, work stress, over sleeping, failure and success. I am learning how to make myself better. I think my 17+ years of studying life itself can help someone. _**I am not perfect. Everything written in this journal is dynamic, mutable, not the only way or the only truth. This is not the only thing that works. There can be many ways. However, if something is not working for you; you can experiment with what has worked for me.**_

This journal has been made by [Sagar Dhirajlal Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srdpatel/) to understand emotions, motives, feelings, basic instincts, motivation, inspiration, reason behind various psychological facts, results and actions of human beings. Once we know how it works, we can try to make it better to build a great and positive future for allâ€¦
