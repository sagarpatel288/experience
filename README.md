# About this journal

Sharing my life experience with the hope that it can be of some help to someone.

From being an A-Grade student to becoming a failure, from serving as an unofficial assistant in a local mobile repairing shop to graduating as a student, from a non-IT graduate to becoming Google certified and a professional developer, I have learned to embrace the roller-coaster ride of life. This is especially due to my habit of documenting my feelings and emotions, and frequently analyzing them to continuously improve myself. I have encountered family stress, domestic violence, bullying, toxic people, depression, chronic illness, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, hypersensitivity, work stress, oversleeping, failure, and success. I am dedicated to making myself better. I believe that my 17+ years of studying life itself can be of help to someone. _**I am not perfect. Everything written in this journal is dynamic and mutable, not the only way or the absolute truth. There are multiple approaches that can be effective. However, if something is not working for you, you can experiment with what has worked for me.**_

This journal has been created by [Sagar Dhirajlal Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srdpatel/) to explore emotions, motives, feelings, basic instincts, motivation, inspiration, and the reasons behind various psychological facts, results, and actions of human beings. Once we understand how it works, we can strive to improve it in order to build a great and positive future for all.
